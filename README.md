# Sorting-Program-based-on-MLP
Sorting Program based on MLP with 3 hidden layers in Java and Python.
Multi layer perceptron (MLP) is a supplement of feed forward neural network.
The program will consist of the following units:
Loading the training and control sets (from files) and encoding the
categories (defining the desired outputs for each category).
Defining the architecture of the MLP network.
Implement the gradient descent training algorithm and updating the 
weights per groups of B examples (mini-batches) considering N
examples of the training set. After training of the network is finished,
calculation of the skill generalization of the resulting network and the
percentage of correct decisions in the whole control set are made.
The generateData.java randomly generates 8000 examples (4000 for the 
training set and 4000 for the control) and ranks them in one of three categories. 
The output of the program will be saved in datatest.txt. To display the examples in a 
diagram we have made the program graphmaker.py.Each time we run the program different
results will come out, so are the files firstcomb.txt,secondcomb.txt,thirdcomb.txt,fourthcomb.txt
will have each time different results.
This project was done in collaboration with two other fellow students.
